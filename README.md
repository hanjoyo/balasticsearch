# BalasticSearch
I'm trying to make search engine which has interface which easy to understand for people who familiar with elasticsearch, you can say elasticsearch without JVM ;)

So this is powered by blevesearch, so the feature implemented here will not far from what bleve provide. There are some features which I want to add like sharding and clustering which I already have the rough idea.
